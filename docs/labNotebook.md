- when we move some parts we'll have to clamp the position in order to remain inside of the fabric
- how to deal with "copies" of the masks? I want to have multiple sets of pieces with different origins and orientations without copying all the other properties
- how to deal with orientation when computing overlap, and when drawing the masks on the fabric?
