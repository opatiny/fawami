# Existing genetic algorithm libraries in JS

- https://npm.io/package/genetic-lab
- https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm: good but old library, no typing, had a bug with the data types internally, where instead of the gene, the parent is a fitness data object
- https://npm.io/package/genetic.ts: TS lib, looks quite good but the data format isn't super clear. Old and not maintained, github repo does not exist anymore.
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/gntc
