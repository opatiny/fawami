# Using deepnest.io

We might use `deepnest.io` to compare our results to some existing software.

## Tips

- SVG scale: in old versions of inkscape, it was 90 DPI, but in newer versions it changed to 96 DPI, so be careful
- If some parts are one in another in the SVG, they will be treated as a single part!!! So you have to draw your material rectangle **next** to the other parts, and not around it....
