crossover:

- pick first parent from best ones and second from the very different ones
- or give weights to pick second parent based on distance
- crossover gives diversity

enhance mutate:

- make sure that the mutation applied leads to a better solution
- move each piece one after the other
- mutate brings quality
- use mutateAndKeepBest

asynchronous functions:

- do we have some async? if so be really careful with random values!!

issue with best individual contaminating all population:

- create threshold on children, they should be different enough from the elite to be added to population
- create one child at a time and check if it can join the elite, or if it's different enough from the pool of varied solutions
- elite should be small (3-5 individuals)
