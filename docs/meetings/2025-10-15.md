## Questions

- can I write the report in english?
- access to the github repo

Thoughts on the genetic algorithm:

- there is a limited number of acceptable solutions, that is the solution space
- the goal of the GA is to cross acceptable solutions and only keep the best ones at each generation
- a gene is the array of the coordinates of the parts
- how to handle the rotations in the GA?
- the fitness function has 2 parameters at once: minimize overlap area, and minimize length of fabric used

## notes

- rotate vectorial and then pixellize to avoid holes issues
- difficile de minimiser un maximum

- chaque solution a la longueur du nb de pièces
- 3 parameters: row, column and orientation
- interesting GA libraries: when they learn the optimal parameters by themselves

- make the utils to switch from low to high res

mutation:

- move a little bit and check if it's better, if it is continue moving in the same direction

GA:

- create one new solution by crossover
- make mutations on it iteratively and keep the best child (memetic algorithm: repeated "smart" mutations)
- add it to the population
- keep only the best solutions

- keep enough diversity in the population -> measure distance between 2 individuals
- keep solutions that are not great but really different
- have two pools of solutions, 1 with good ones and one with high variability
