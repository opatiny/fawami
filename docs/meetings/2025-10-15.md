## Questions

- can I write the report in english?
- access to the github repo

Thoughts on the genetic algorithm:

- there is a limited number of acceptable solutions, that is the solution space
- the goal of the GA is to cross acceptable solutions and only keep the best ones at each generation
- a gene is the array of the coordinates of the parts
- how to handle the rotations in the GA?
