- pixelize the shapes
- each part is a binary mask
- fabric is a matrix of integers

  - 0: no part placed
  - 1: one part is at that position
  - 2: two parts on that pixel
  - ...

- we can make a first approximation with large discretization, e.g. 5x5cm
- refine solution

- solution: vector of (x,y) offsets for each part
- fitness function: nb of pixels in the fabric that have value more than 1

GA

- crossover: average of the offsets of the two genes?
- mutation (local search)

  - identify parts that overlap
  - offset the parts by 1 pixel in al directions (4, 8?)

- kubalik: are they some optimal solutions that are not reachable?

Next steps

1. read an input file
2. separate parts
3. discretize
